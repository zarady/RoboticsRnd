# RoboticsRnd

This webpage demonstrates a robotic arm simulation designed to help visualize and understand how DH (Denavit-Hartenberg) parameters work. The goal is to make learning robotic kinematics more intuitive and interactive.

To run the project, simply open a terminal in this folder and execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

Then, open the provided port route in your browser to view the simulation.
